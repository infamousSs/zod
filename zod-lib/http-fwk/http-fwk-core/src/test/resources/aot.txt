Guren no Yumiya
Bài hát của Amanda Lee
Lời bài hát
Sie sind das Essen und wir sind die Jäger!
(Wir sind der Jäger!)
(Wir sind der Jäger!)
Our names won't be remembered
If we die like trampled flowers
I refuse to be forgotten
Written off as less than worthless
Scream and cry
But none will hear you
Plead and beg
But none will help you
You no longer live as cattle
Will you rise and join the battle?
There are beings that live off of fears
And their words are like knives
As they play with our lives
They'll try to control you
As if they own you
Will you let them steal your freedom?
Channel the anger swelling inside you
Fighting the boundary 'till you break through
Deep in your soul there's no hesitation
So make yourself the one, Jäger
There is a wild fire inside you
Burning desire you can't extinguish
Your crimson arrow
Rips through the twilight
This is the moment for war
Hunt your prey, and act
Draw your arrow back
Never let them get away
Set the arrow free
On your enemy
Never let them get away
Pull the bowstring back
Just before it snaps
Feel the tension in your fingers
As they're frozen still
Go in for the kill
Making sure no life will linger
It's not the hunter - Not the weapon
To guarantee the kill, all that counts in the end
Is your determination, rivaling the hunger of your slayer's will!
We are the hunters!
Unforgiving like a raging fire
Yes, we are the hunters!
Merciless, we are as cold as ice
We are the hunters!
Let the arrow nearly draw you in
Yes, we are the hunters!
And strike at anything that comes your way!
